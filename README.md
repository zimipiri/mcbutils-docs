# mcbutils-docs
Up-to-date documentation regarding the Breakdown: Utilities mod.

# Functionalities
- Mortar Range real-time calculations (in blocks)
- Mortar Range real-time visual trajectory (green line rendered onto the screen)
- Customizable keybinds
- Advanced Customizable Keybinds, enabled (or disabled) through the use of the Utils Settings
- Packet Sender / Tester for Minecraft: Breakdown (some packets don't work for logical reasons)

# Advanced Keybinds
With the provided Advanced Keybinds you're able to send certain packets to the server.
Some of which are pretty useful, meanwhile other are useless.

For security reasons they are disabled by default, and can only be enabled through the Utils Settings menu.

# Macros
You are able to quickly go to spawn by pressing a single keybind (also customizable).
This keybind only send a chat message that is "/sz".

# Upcoming Features
I have plenty of upcoming features planned for release, some of which may require being accepted by either Inforno,
blooditor or anybody else who has decisional power.
